# Retrackt

Retrackt is a streamlit web application that allows users to discover if their photographs have been reposted on Reddit. 

## Current focus

Retrackt allows users to: 

- Upload an image 
- Scan a specified Reddit subreddit for similar images
- Display the top 3 most similar images 

The main focus of this project is to help users trace non-consensual reposting of non-intimate images of themselves on Reddit. 

## Demo

[Watch the demo](demo.mp4)

## Limitations 

- Reddit API allows us to scan the most recent/latest 1000 posts (rate limit of 1000)
- This project is restricted to Reddit as of now, with plans to expand to other social media platforms
- We request you to upload an image instead of pasting an Instagram URL of your preferred post

## Roadmap

### In Progress
- Research Report (Due Sep 30)
- Expand similarity matching display and make the project accessible (or live) via https://retrackt.streamlit.app/ (Due Sep 30)

### Not Started
- Refactor Image Fetching Script (Due Oct 31 )
- Automate Daily Fetching (Due Oct 31)
- Build FASTAPI Service (Due Oct 31)
- Feedback (Round 1) (and further iteration) (Due Oct 2)
